        "If we add more data points, then we would be able to know overlap.\n",
        "If we remove overlapped columns, then we get good model\n",
        "For ex. If we remove sepal length & sepal width which is almost 50% of my data, then also we can do the prediction because other 2 columns also have 3 classes which we require to make predictions. \n",

        "__Good things:__\n",
        "\n",
        "-\tThe prediction with 2 columns is always better than 4 columns because it gives more accurate results & faster than 4 columns. So its always better to work on less amount of data than higher amount.\n",
